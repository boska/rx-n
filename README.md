Boska is a padawan of Rx. 

rx-n is a series of RxSwift projects generated during the job interviews
 
RxSwift is one of the ways that try to solve async problem differs from UIKit or PromiseKit, rx-n series shows how dangerous to use a powerful tool before master it.
Again, thanks to job interviews and it just a code challenge, no one hurts don't worry.

`Exposing Subjects - this for me is a massive red flag that someone doesn't know about how Rx works, or cares to match the Rx style.`

😱
